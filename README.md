# FancyIndex

Fancy (and a little bit responsive) theme for Apache directory & file listings.

## Installation

Customize httpd-autoindex.conf and replace with that in "[apache dir]\conf\extra\".
Don't worry about backup if you have "conf\original\extra" files.

Make sure if mod_autoindex is on.
Restart server. Works for me ;)
